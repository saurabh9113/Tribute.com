           <b>Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani</b>  born on 19 April 1957 is an Indian billionaire businessman who is the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries.He is the richest person in Asia and 9th richest in the world.Sometimes characterized as a plutocrat,he has attracted both fame and notoriety for reports of market manipulation, political corruption, cronyism, and exploitation.In October 2024, Ambani was ranked 1st on the Forbes list of India's 100 richest tycoons, with a net worth of $119.5 billion.Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958 to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles.The latter was originally named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal".His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance.Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors.
